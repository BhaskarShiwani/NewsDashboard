# News Search & User Authentication System

Welcome to the **News Search & User Authentication** project! This is a simple web application that allows users to search for news articles and view detailed information. If the user is not logged in, they will be prompted to sign up or log in before proceeding with viewing the full article. The project also includes a **popup-based login/signup system** that simulates user authentication with local storage.

## Features

- **Search News**: Fetch and display the latest news articles based on your search query.
- **Popup Login/Signup**: Users must log in or sign up before accessing premium content.
- **Payment Simulation**: After successful login, users can proceed to payment (simulated).
- **Attractive UI**: Designed with a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

1. **Clone this repository**:

2. Open the project: Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in your browser.

4. User Authentication:

      - If you're logged in, you can directly proceed with the premium content.

5. Payment Simulation: After login, you can proceed with the simulated payment flow (you can replace this with actual payment logic if needed).
